## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
plot_grid(
  ggplot(pH_10min, aes(DateTime, pH))+
  geom_point(size=2,color="grey40")+
  geom_point(data=notes, aes(DateTime, pH), color="red2", size=3),

ggplot(pH_comparison, aes(Handheld_pH, Sensor_pH))+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(7.8, 8.7))+
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(7.8, 8.7))+
  geom_abline(slope=1, size=1, linetype="dashed")+
  xlab("Handheld pH")+
  ylab("Sensor pH"),

ncol=2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
