# Hall lab headspace equilibration correction comparison

## Main folder
a. "Differences between Kos and Hall.Rmd" - Rmarkdown file of compare major differences between our group (Hall lab) and that of Koschorreck et al. for calculating the CO2 concentration in a water sample after headspace equilibration as a part of our comment to their manuscript in review with Biogeosciences. 
b. "Differences-between-Kos-and-Hall.html" - Knit version of Rmarkdown file

## Data folder


Data folder - data files from MT and AZ streams have the following:<br />
a. Metadata - datetime, location<br />
b. CO2 concentrations in the headspace after equilibration and measurement on the Picarro<br />
c. Alkalinity, pH, barometric pressure, etc.<br />
