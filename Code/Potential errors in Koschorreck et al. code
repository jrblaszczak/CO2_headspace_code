The code below shows how Koschorreck et al. use the alkalinity equation to solve for H^+^

```{r}
 #DIC at equilibrium
    co2 <- Kh * pCO2_eq[i]/1000000
    h_all <- polyroot(c(-(2*K1*K2*co2),-(co2*K1+Kw),AT,1))
    real<-Re(h_all)
    h <-real[which(real>0)]
    DIC_eq <- co2 * (1 + K1/h + K1 * K2/(h * h))
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
